    "We have already shown in class that there are infinitely many primes. For $n\\pmod4$, we see that only forms congruent to $1\\pmod4$ or $3\\pmod4$ may have infinitely primes, since $0\\pmod4$ and $2\\pmod4$ are even. We want to show that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3\\pmod4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use proof by contradiction. Suppose there are a finite number of primes of the form $3\\pmod 4$, sorted in order from $p_{0}, p_{1}, p_{2},...p_{n}$. This would make $p_{0} = 3, p_{1} = 7$, and so on. Now, we consider the number $a = p_{0} \\cdot p_{1} \\cdot p_{2} \\cdot...\\cdot p_{n} + 3$. Note that we are not including $p_{0} = 3$, which will be useful later. Since $a > p_{n}$, under our assumption of finite primes, $a$ must be composite. Now we are interested in finding its factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that $a$ is odd, so it cannot have even factors such as $0\\pmod4$ or $2\\pmod4$. It must have factors of the forms $1\\pmod4$ or $3\\pmod4$. We notice that numbers of the form $4k + 1$ are closed under multiplication, so $a$ must have at least one factor of the form $3\\pmod4$. However, this is impossible because each $p_{1}, p_{1}, p_{2},...p_{n}$ divides $a - 3$ (i.e. $a$ can be written as $3\\pmod {p_{i}}$ where $1 \\le i \\le n$. Since $p_{i} > 3$, we will never get $a = 0\\pmod p_{i}$, so $a$ actually cannot have any factors of the form $3\\pmod4$. Now, we've reached a contradiction, since we earlier showed that $a$ must have factors of the form $3\\pmod4$. Thus, our original premise that there are a finite number of primes of the form $3\\pmod4$ must be false, and there must actually be an infinite number of primes of form $3\\pmod4$.\n",

We note that if we can find a non-zero $r$ in the set $\\{r \\mid L_{r} = 0 \\land L_{r+1} = 1 \\}$, then a cycle consisting of $r$ Fibonacci last digits exists. This is because the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by the previous two elements, so finding consecutive numbers that end in $0$ and $1$, respectively, will be the same as starting a new cycle. Using Mathematica, we see that $F_{60}$ and $F_{61}$ are the first such numbers ending in $0$ and $1$, respectively. Thus, a cycle of last digits exists, and this 60-digit cycle can include all numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (i.e., we don't have a sequence like $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5...$, where the cycle does not include the first three numbers).\n",

These two numbers then define $L_{60*a + 60} = 0$ and $L_{60*a + 61} = 1$. Now, $L_{60*a + 60}$ and $L_{60*a + 61}$ can start a new cycle.

    "Now, we split the problem set proof into two parts, first proving that the cycles are of length equal or less than $m^{2} - 1$, and then proving that there are infinite such cycles. For the first part, let us consider $m > 1$, since the statement does not work for $m = 1$; when $m = 1$, every number is congruent to $0\\pmod 1$, so we have a cycle size of 1, which is greater than $m^{2} - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proof will be similar to a pigeon-hole proof. We will do a proof by contradiction, first assuming that there are at least $m^{2}$ numbers per cycle. Let us consider any $m^{2} + 1$ consecutive Fibonacci numbers $\\pmod m$ (i.e. we have exactly $m^{2}$ numbers in a cycle, so we would be considering all numbers of a cycle, plus the first number of the next cycle). Out of these $m^{2} + 1$ consecutive numbers, we have $m^{2}$ pairings of two consecutive numbers. We are working in $\\pmod m$, so there are exactly $m^{2}$ possible ways to fill these two consecutive spaces. However, we know that two consecutive numbers cannot both be $0 \\pmod m$ because two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are relatively prime. Going back to our $m^{2}$ pairings of two consecutive numbers, we now see that there must be a repeat pairing within these $m^{2} + 1$ numbers, since $(0, 0)$ is not allowed. Let's say that the repeats happen at $(F_{a} \\pmod m, F_{a+1}\\pmod m)$ and $(F_{a+k}\\pmod m, F_{a+k+1}\\pmod m)$. Since we are only talking about $m^{2} + 1$ consecutive numbers, $\\mathbf{k \\le m^{2} -1}$. However, notice that by having repeated consecutive number pairs, we are starting the cycle again; this is because the Fibonacci sequence is recursively defined by the two previous numbers. In other words, $F_{a+l}$ = $F_{a+k+l}$ for any $\\mathrm{l} \\in \\mathbb N$, and the cycle length is $k$. Our original assumption of having a cycle length of at least $m^{2}$ means that $k \\ge m^{2}$. This contradicts the boldface claim above, suggesting that our original assumption is incorrect. In other words, cycles are of length equal or less than $m^{2} - 1$.\n",

    "Now, we show that there are infinite such cycles. Let $c \\le m^{2} - 1$ be the number of elements per cycle. Suppose instead that we have a finite number $a + 1$ cycles. This means that after $c*a + c$ numbers, we no longer have cycles. Let's look at the two numbers immediately before, and they are still in a cycle so $L_{c*a + c-2} = L_{c*a - 2}$ and $L_{c*a + c-1} = L_{c*a -1}$. These two numbers then define $L_{c*a + c} = L_{c*a}$ and $L_{c*a + c+1} = L_{c*a + 1}$. Now, $L_{c*a + c}$ and $L_{c*a + c + 1}$ can start a new cycle, since the Fibonacci numbers are defined recursively by two consecutive numbers. This contradicts our assumption that there would be no more cycles after $c*a + c$ numbers. Thus, our original assumption is wrong, and there are an infinite number of such cycles.\n",
