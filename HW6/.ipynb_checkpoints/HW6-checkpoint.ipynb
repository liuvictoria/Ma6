    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "From the last equality, we see that the form of $f$ must take the form $f = cx$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We can further prove that $f = cx$ actually works as an isomorphism from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to itself under addition. Let $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, and we write down the definition of the isomorphism:\n",

    "This is true by the distributive property of multiplication over addition, so $f = cx$ is indeed an isomorphism from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to itself under addition. Interestingly, our initial assumption that $f(1) = c$ implies that $c$ must be a rational number as well, since we are mapping rational numbers to rational numbers. However, since the distributive property works on all real numbers, $c$ can actually be any real number. The problem did not define any restrictions for $c$, so we are good. For further proof of this, we can also see that $f(0) = 0$ for all $c$, so that the identity element maps to the identify element. The set $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not cyclic because there are no generators for the identity element, so there is no order of the group that we would need to consider.\n",

    "For the second part of the question, yes, $f = cx$ also holds for the group $\\{ a + b \\sqrt{2} : a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\}$. We will do a direct proof. We note that because $\\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number, multiplying it by any rational number will still result in an irrational number from which $\\sqrt{2}$ can be factored out. We easily see that addition of a number in $\\{ a + b \\sqrt{2} : a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\}$ to another number in $\\{ a + b \\sqrt{2} : a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\}$ will result in a number in $\\{ a + b \\sqrt{2} : a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\}$. Put simply, this set is closed under addition; this makes sense, because the problem actually tells us that $\\{ a + b \\sqrt{2} : a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\}$ is a group, so it would have to be closed under its operation of addition anyway. Now, we can take a hint from linear algebra and think of of the number $a + b \\sqrt{2}$ as having two orthogonal \"bases\"--$1$ and $\\sqrt{2}$. Now, we are just concerned about the coefficients of our bases, and we borrow the idea of direct products from group theory to finish our proof. Specifically, since the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are both elements of $\\mathbb{Q}$, we say that our direct product is of $\\mathbb{Q} \\ x \\ \\mathbb{Q}$ and consists of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This is the exact definition of the coefficients given in the problem, but we have now converted them into direct products, and now we can use the fact that this direct product is a group.\n",

The first three digits are always $1$'s, and we could have any number, up to $n-4$, of $1$'s following these first three, until we get two a $0$.

    "We will do a pigeonhole proof. Let's actually create $2020$ new numbers. Each new number $s_{n}$ will be the sum of the first $n$ numbers that we wrote on the blackboard. This will lead to $2020$ new numbers. Since we're not limiting the numbers to positive or negative numbers, $s_{n}$ may get larger or smaller as $n$ increases; however, all numbers added earlier will be present in later sums. For each number $s_{n}$, we write it $\\pmod{2020}$. There are two scenarios: either there is already a number $s_{n}$ that can be written as $0 \\pmod{2020}$ or there are no numbers of the form $s_{n}$ that can be written as $0 \\pmod{2020}$. In the first scenario, we would be done because $s_{n}$ would represent the \"subset of numbers so that their sum is a multiple of $2020$.\" In the second scenario, the sums can only be congruent to $1 \\pmod{2020}$ through to $2019 \\pmod{2020}$; if it is congruent to a number greater than $2019$, it can be re-written in terms of a number between $1$ and $2019$. In other words, there are $2019$ different congruencies, $\\pmod{2020}$. Since we have $2020$ sums, at least two sums must have the same congruency. Let's say $s_{a}$ and $s_{b}$ are both congruent to $r \\pmod{2020}$. Say $a > b$. If $b > a$, simply switch the values of $s_{a}$ and $s_{b}$ so that $s_{a} > s_{b}$. Then, we have:\n",

    "s_{a} &\\equiv r \\pmod{2020} \\\\[1em]\n",
    "s_{b} &\\equiv r \\pmod{2020} \\\\[1em]\n",
    "s_{a} - s_{b} &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{2020}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $s_{a} > s_{b}$ and $s_{n}$ was defined such that all previous sums are included, $s_{a} - s_{b}$ will be the sum of a subset of the $2020$ numbers, specifically those whose indices are greater than $b$ and less than or equal to $a$. This sum is also congruent to $0 \\pmod{2020}$, so it is a multiple of $2020$, and we are done.\n",
