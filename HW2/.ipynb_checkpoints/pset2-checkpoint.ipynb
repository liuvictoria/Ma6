We will do a pigeonhole proof. Let's separate the problem into two scenarios: one where a graph of $n \\ge 2$ vertices is completely connected, and one where the graph of $n \\ge 2$ vertices is not completely connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first scenario where the graph is completely connected, individual vertices can have degrees $1$ to $n-1$; none of the vertices can have degree $0$ because the graph is fully connected, and none of the vertices can have degrees greater than $n-1$ because the graph is assumed to be simple. However, note that we have $n$ vertices in total, and the pigeonhole principle suggests that at least two vertices will share the same degree.\n",

    "In the second scenario where the graph is not completely connected, individual vertices can have degrees $0$ to $n - 2$. We cannot have a vertex of degree $n - 1$ because that would imply that it is connected to all the other vertices and the graph is completely connected. Again, since we have more vertices ($n$) than the number of degrees, at least two vertices will share the same degree.\n",

Let's call the first path $Path \\ X$ and the second path $Path \\ Y$. Since the graph is connected, we will be able to find a $Path \\ C$ between $Path \\ X$ and $Path \\ Y$. Say this connecting path connects vertex $a$ of $Path \\ X$ to vertex $b$ of $Path \\ Y$; the connecting path may be a single edge or consist of multiple edges, but it is at least one edge long. Now, we see that vertex $a$ divides $Path \\ X$ into two segments, and $b$ divides $Path \\ Y$ into two segments as well. We examine the longer segments of $Path \\ X$ and $Path \\ Y$ (or, if the vertices divide $Path \\ X$ or $Path \\ Y$ into equal segments, we can choose either segment), and we can create a path with these two segments, connected by $Path \\ C$ at vertices $a$ and $b$. This path is will be longer than either $Path \\ X$ or $Path \\ Y$ because it will be at least one edge longer, due to the connecting $Path \\ C$. This is a contradiction toward our original premise that $Path \\ X$ and $Path \\ Y$ are the longest paths, and it shows that two maximum length paths in a connected graph must intersect.\n",

Then, putting these two pieces together, a non-path tree graph must have at least three leaves.\n",

Let $V$ represent the set of all vertices in the tree, $s$ represent the subset of leaves, $n$ represent the total number of nodes (i.e. $|V| = n$), and $degree(v)$ represent the degree of vertex $v$. We note that the total number of edges is $n - 1$ since there are no cycles, and the sum of the vertex degrees is $2(n-1)$ since each edge is counted twice. The sum of the vertex degrees can then be written as:\n",

We note that every tree must have a unique path between two vertices; if there was more than one path between two vertices, then we would have a cycle in the tree. Let's examine the path between two leaves of a two-leaf tree. Since the tree is fully connected, the only path from one leaf to the other traverses all the vertices, making the two-leaf tree a path graph. Thus, a non-path tree must have at least three vertices. It is easy to create such a tree; take a root node and have three children nodes that are all leaves.\n",
