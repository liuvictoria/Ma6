    "I believe this can be solved using permutations, by \"disrupting\" long cycles by a single transformation. Bob and Charlie should choose a strategy before the game, and we describe how Charlie and Bob should each act to win. We will start with Charlie (even though he acts after Bob) since his action is more straightforward. When Charlie comes in and hears Alice's number $N$, he should open the $\\textit{box}$ number $N$. Say he finds a note with the number $M$ on it, he should next look in box $M$, and so on. Now, the issue here is how many boxes will Charlie go through before he finds the box with card number $N$? If Bob does not \"transform\" the boxes, Charlie may be unlucky and need to go through all $100$ boxes before finding $N$, losing the game. Mathematically, needing to go through $100$ boxes this would be the same as permutation with a single cycle, where all $100$ numbers in the same cycle. To clarify the permutation idea more generally, the way Alice places the cards in the boxes will create a unique permutation when Charlie chooses boxes based on the card numbers he finds. The permutation will take a number $A$ to the number $B$ if and only if card $B$ is found in box $A$, and the longest cycle here is $100$. Notably, if Bob and Charlie can guarantee that the longest cycle in the permutation is $50$ and Charlie knows which cycle to look through, then Charlie will be able to finish the cycle within $50$ box openings, find $N$, and win. bob can guarantee that the longest cycle in the permutation is $50$ because he knows what cards are in what boxes. If Alice's original card placement does not create cycles greater than length $50$, then Bob can choose not to switch any boxes (or if the game requires him to switch two boxes, he can just switch two boxes within the same cycle, thereby creating two even smaller cycles from that cycle). If Alice's original card placement creates a permutation with a cycle $C$ greater than length $50$ (and note, only once cycle could be greater than $50$ since there only $100$ boxes), Bob can always find two boxes in this cycle $C$ to switch, such that the two resulting cycles are both less than $50$. Bob's switch is the same as a transformation; we can think of Alice's original card placement as permutation $\\alpha$, and Bob's transformation as $\\tau$. If $tau$ is done to two boxes within the same cycle, $\\tau \\alpha$ will split up the cycle that $\\tau$ acted on. To ensure that the split-up cycles are both less than $50$, Bob should choose two boxes that are \"separated\" by $\\alpha^{\\lceil |C|/2 \\rceil}$ permutations, where $|C|$ represents the length of the cycle we are trying to break up (i.e. |C| > 50); the ceiling function is there to account for odd $|C|$. It is now evident that $\\tau \\alpha$ will result in a new permutation, the one that Charlie sees, where all the cycles are less than length $50$. Now, how can we guarantee that Charlie will start looking in the cycle that contains $N$? This is very easy--since he is starting with box number $N$, he is automatically in the right cycle. Thus, we have shown that a winning strategy exists, no matter how Alice plays.\n",

    "We will do a proof by contradiction. Let's suppose that we can actually reach the sequence $2, 1, 3, 4, 5$. We can think of rotations and reflections as permutations of the labeled vertices. For example, starting at $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$, a clockwise rotation $75$ degrees would result in $5, 4, 3, 2, 1$. We can see that rotations shift every number by one, an operation that can be done by four transpositions. This means that rotations are all even permutations. In addition, reflections are also even permutations; a reflection will stabilize one vertex and transpose two pairs of vertices. In the example given in the problem, since we are reflecting over the line of symmetry passing through vertex $1$, $1$ is stabilized. The transpositions are then $(2, 5)(3, 4)$, which is even. Since all of the allowed permutations are even, all the compositions of permutations are even as well, and allowed sequences can only be reached through even permutations, meaning that $2, 1, 3, 4, 5$ must be reachable through an even permutation. However, that is not true, because we can visit $2, 1, 3, 4, 5$ using an odd permutation (i.e. the transposition $(1, 2)$), contradicting the stipulation that it can only be reached with even permutations.\n",

Then, we switch $1$ and $2$, which are in the original positions of $k$ and $k+1$, respectively, with $\\tau$. Finally, we cycle back in the other direction by composing $c$ onto itself $k-1$ times until we are back to our original sequence, except with $k$ and $k + 1$ switched. Mathematically, it looks like: $c^{k-1} \\cdot \\tau \\cdot c^{1-k}$. This algorithm holds for all $1 \\le k \\le n-1$.\n",

    "Now that we've shown that $c$ and $\\tau$ generate all \"consecutive\" transpositions, we will use induction to prove that the set of consecutive transpositions generate all transpositions $(p \\ q)$ in $S_{n}$. Without loss of generality, we assume that $q > p$, and we can use induction on the difference between $q$ and $p$. For our base case, when $q - p = 1$, it's evident that the consecutive transpositions can generate $(p \\ q)$ because $(p \\ q)$ would actually be a consecutive transposition. Now for our inductive hypothesis, suppose that all transpositions where $q - p \\le r$ can be generated by the \"consecutive\" transpositions, where $1 \\le r \\le n - 2$. For $q - p = r + 1$, we can generate $(p \\ q)$ as such:\n",

Thus, we've found a composition of permutations for when $q - p = r + 1$, and our induction is complete; all sets of transpositions $(p \\ q)$ can be \"generated\" from $\\tau$ and $c$. We learned in class that all cycles and permutations can be decomposed into transpositions, so $\\tau$ and $c$ can \"generate\" all $(m \\ n)$ where \n",

    "We will do a direct proof. It will be sufficient to show that the set of ${n - 1 \\choose 2} + 1$ transpositions can generate all transpositions in $S_{n}$, since all permutations in $S_{n}$ can be decomposed into compositions of transpositions. We immediately note that a set $T$ of ${n - 1 \\choose 2} + 1$ unique transpositions must have all $n$ numbers (i.e. $1$, $2$, $3$,...$n$) in at least one transposition, because the total number of unique transpositions in $S_{n-1}$ is ${n - 1 \\choose 2}$, so adding $1$ transposition would require including the $n^{th}$ number. Now, how can we compose our current transpositions to 'generate' every transposition in $S_{n}$? We can think of this in terms of graph theory; each number is a node, and each edge is a transposition in the set $T$. Since we have $n$ numbers, there will be $n$ nodes, and there will be ${n-1 \\choose 2} + 1$ edges. Since every number is part of a transposition, this graph is connected; this fact can also be seen because the number of edges to fully connect any subset of $n-1$ nodes is ${n - 1 \\choose 2}$, so ${n-1 \\choose 2} + 1$ edges must connect an $n^{th}$ node. Since the graph is connected, there exists a path between any two nodes, meaning that we can always find a composition of transpositions between two numbers. The algorithm to actually find the composition would be as follows: we run BFS to find the shortest distance between two nodes, and we start at one of our numbers in the transposition. Along each edge, we perform the transposition defined by that edge, and we do this until we reach the other number. Once we reach the second number, we go back the way we came from, \"unperforming\" each transposition until we get back to our original number. Note that we don't \"unperform\" the last transposition before reaching the second number; otherwise, we'd just be doing the identity element! We don't want any numbers to change positions except for the two in the transposition, and this is accomplished by \"place-holding\" along the forward path; each time we traverse an edge in the forward path (i.e. perform a transposition), one number will hold the place for the other number in transposition, allowing that number to go back to its original position in the backward path. However, the two original numbers (i.e. the number at the start and end of the path) don't have place-holders, and end up getting transposed. The connected nature of the graph guarantees a transposition between all pairs of numbers in $S_{n}$, so we are done.\n",
